# Web UI Guide

The CCCC Web UI is a mobile-first control plane for managing your AI agents.

## Accessing the Web UI

After starting CCCC:

```bash
cccc
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8848/ in your browser.

## Interface Overview

The Web UI has these main areas:

- **Header**: Group selector, settings, theme toggle
- **Sidebar**: Group list and navigation
- **Tabs**: Chat tab + one tab per agent
- **Main Area**: Chat messages or terminal view
- **Input**: Message composer with @mention support

## Managing Groups

### Creating a Group

1. Click the **+** button in the sidebar
2. Or use CLI: `cccc attach /path/to/project`

### Switching Groups

Click on a group in the sidebar to switch.

### Group Settings

1. Click the **Settings** icon in the header
2. Configure:
   - Group title
   - Guidance (preamble/help)
   - Built-in automation, rules, and snippets
   - Delivery and messaging defaults

## Messaging

2. Press `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter`, or click Send

### @Mentions

Type `@` to trigger autocomplete:

- `@foreman` - Send to the foreman
- `@peers` - Send to all peers
- `@<actor_id>` - Send to specific agent

### Replying

Click the reply icon on a message to quote and reply.

## Context Panel

The Context panel shows shared project state (v2):

### Presence

Agent runtime status and capsule (short-term memory: focus, blockers, next action).

### Vision

One-sentence project goal. Agents should align with this.

### Overview

Structured project view with manual section (roles, collaboration mode, current focus) and live daemon-computed snapshot.

### Tasks

Multi-level task tree. Root tasks = phases/stages. Child tasks = execution units. Each task has steps and acceptance criteria.

## Settings Panel

Access via the gear icon:

### Automation

- **Built-in Automation**: Configure system-managed follow-ups and collaboration health loops such as unread / reply-required / ACK follow-ups, actor idle alerts, keepalive, silence checks, and help nudges.
- **Rules**: Create scheduled reminders with interval / recurring schedule / one-time schedule.
- **Actions**:
  - `Send Reminder` (normal reminder delivery)
  - `Set Group Status` (operational, one-time only)
  - `Control Actor Runtimes` (operational, one-time only)
- **Snippets**: Reusable message templates managed alongside rules.
- **One-time behavior**: One-time rules auto-complete after firing, then can be cleaned up from completed list.

### IM Bridge

Configure Telegram, Slack, Discord, Feishu, or DingTalk integration.

### Group Space

Configure provider-backed shared memory per group:

- Provider credential (masked metadata only)
- Health check
- Binding (`remote_space_id`, optional auto-create)
- `Sync Now` two-way reconcile button:
  - local `repo/space/` resources -> provider,
  - provider source/artifact projection -> local `repo/space/`
- Ingest/query/jobs controls

For end-to-end setup details, see: `Group Space + NotebookLM`.

### Theme

Switch between Light, Dark, or System theme.

## Mobile Usage

The Web UI is responsive and works well on mobile:

- Swipe between tabs
- Pull down to refresh
- Tap and hold for context menus
- Works in mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari)

## Remote Access

To access from outside your local network:

### Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended)

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:8848
```

### Tailscale

```bash
CCCC_WEB_HOST=$(tailscale ip -4) cccc
```

### Security

Before exposing the Web UI beyond localhost, first create an **Admin Access Token** in **Settings > Web Access**.

Then authenticate once to bootstrap the session cookie:

- Open `http://YOUR_HOST:8848/?token=<access-token>` (or `.../ui/?token=...`) using an Access Token created in Web Access.

After that, you can use the Web UI normally without `?token=...`.
