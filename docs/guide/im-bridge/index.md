# IM Bridge Overview

Bridge your CCCC working group to popular IM platforms for mobile access.

## What is IM Bridge?

The IM Bridge allows you to:

- Send messages to agents from your phone
- Receive updates and notifications
- Control the group with slash commands
- Share files and attachments

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Status | Best For |
|----------|--------|----------|
| [Telegram](./telegram) | ✅ | Personal use, quick setup |
| [Slack](./slack) | ✅ | Team collaboration |
| [Discord](./discord) | ✅ | Community/gaming |
| [Feishu/Lark](./feishu) | ✅ | Enterprise (China/Global) |
| [DingTalk](./dingtalk) | ✅ | Enterprise (China) |

## Design Principles

- **1 Group = 1 Bot**: Each working group connects to one bot instance for simplicity and isolation
- **Explicit subscription**: Users must `/subscribe` before receiving messages
- **Thin ports**: IM bridges only forward messages; the daemon is the single source of truth

## Common Commands

Once subscribed to any platform, these commands work universally:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/send <message>` | Send to foreman (default) |
| `/send @<actor> <message>` | Send to specific actor |
| `/send @all <message>` | Send to all agents |
| `/send @peers <message>` | Send to non-foreman agents |
| `/subscribe` | Start receiving messages |
| `/unsubscribe` | Stop receiving messages |
| `/status` | Show group status |
| `/pause` | Pause message delivery |
| `/resume` | Resume message delivery |
| `/verbose` | Toggle verbose mode |
| `/help` | Show help |

::: tip Implicit Send
On all platforms, @mentioning the bot (in groups) or sending a direct message with plain text is automatically treated as `/send` to the **foreman**. You only need the explicit `/send` command when targeting specific agents.
