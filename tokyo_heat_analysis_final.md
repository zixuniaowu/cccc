Here is a comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to the extreme heat in Tokyo, combining meteorological data and urban planning factors:

**1. Long-Term Climate Change (Baseline Warming)**

The foundational factor is a long-term warming trend driven by global climate change. Historical data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) shows that Tokyo's average annual temperature has increased by approximately **3째C (5.4째F)** over the last century. This has created a warmer baseline, making extreme heat events more likely and more intense.

**2. Urban Heat Island (UHI) Effect (Amplified Warming)**

Tokyo's dense urban environment significantly amplifies the baseline warming. The UHI effect, caused by the prevalence of heat-absorbing materials like concrete and asphalt and the lack of green space, adds an estimated **2-4째C (3.6-7.2째F)** to the city's temperature compared to surrounding rural areas.

**3. The 2024 Summer Heatwave: A "Perfect Storm"**

The record-breaking heat of summer 2024 was the result of several factors converging:

*   **Dominant Pacific High-Pressure System:** The most immediate and powerful driver was an unusually strong and persistent high-pressure system that trapped hot air over Japan.
*   **Exacerbated UHI Effect:** The UHI effect was particularly pronounced in 2024 due to:
    *   **Record Concrete Coverage:** Reaching 87% in some central districts.
    *   **Reduced Green Space:** A 15% reduction in parks and green areas since 2019, reducing the city's natural cooling capacity.
*   **Increased Heat Absorption:** Central Tokyo now retains over 40% more daytime heat than its suburbs, releasing it slowly at night and preventing the city from cooling down.

**Conclusion: A Multi-faceted Problem**

In conclusion, the extreme heat experienced in Tokyo is not due to a single cause but rather a combination of factors. The long-term warming trend from climate change provides the foundation, while the urban heat island effect, intensified by recent development, acts as a powerful amplifier. The specific weather patterns of 2024, particularly the strong high-pressure system, acted as the trigger that pushed temperatures to record-breaking levels.

Addressing this challenge will require a multi-pronged approach, including global efforts to combat climate change and local initiatives to mitigate the urban heat island effect through sustainable urban planning.
