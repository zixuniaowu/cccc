Based on the available data, here is an analysis of the long-term temperature trend in Tokyo and its relation to the 2024 summer heatwave:

**Long-Term Temperature Trend in Tokyo**

Historical data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), as reported by multiple sources, shows a significant warming trend in Tokyo over the last century. The average annual temperature has increased by approximately **3째C (5.4째F)**. This trend is a clear indicator of a changing climate in the region.

**The 2024 Summer Heatwave in Context**

The summer of 2024 was a stark manifestation of this long-term trend. It was the **hottest summer on record** for Japan (in a tie with 2023), with the average temperature being **1.76째C (3.17째F)** above the 30-year average. This extreme event is not an isolated incident but rather part of a pattern of increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves.

**Causes of the 2024 Heatwave**

The immediate cause of the 2024 heatwave was a **stronger-than-usual Pacific high-pressure system** that trapped warm air over Japan. However, this event was exacerbated by the underlying **long-term warming trend** caused by global climate change. The combination of these factors led to the record-breaking temperatures experienced across the country.

In summary, the 2024 heatwave in Tokyo was a significant event that aligns with the long-term warming trend observed in the city. It serves as a clear example of how global warming is contributing to more extreme weather events.
