"""Capability surface model for MCP tool progressive disclosure.

This module defines:
1) default core tool set (always visible),
2) optional built-in capability packs (enable-on-demand),
3) built-in capsule-runtime skills (enable-on-demand),
4) helper utilities for deriving visible MCP tool names.
