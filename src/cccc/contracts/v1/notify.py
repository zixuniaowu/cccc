"""System notification contracts.

System notifications are separated from chat messages to avoid polluting user conversations.

Kinds:
- nudge: remind an actor to handle unread messages
- keepalive: remind an actor to continue work (after detecting a "Next:" declaration)
- help_nudge: remind an actor to refresh the collaboration playbook (cccc_help)
- actor_idle: actor idle alert (to foreman)
- silence_check: group silence alert (to foreman)
- standup: periodic stand-up reminder (to foreman)
- status_change: actor/group status change
- error: system error
