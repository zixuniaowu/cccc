P <<Initial findings on 2024 summer heat>> ; Hook: Synthesized findings from news reports on JMA data. ; Next: Proceed with historical data comparison.

EVIDENCE:
- The summer of 2024 was the joint-hottest on record in Japan, tying with 2023.
- July 2024 was the hottest July on record.
- A strong Pacific high-pressure system is cited as the primary driver, amplified by a long-term warming trend.
- I encountered difficulties accessing the primary JMA reports directly via their website (multiple 404 errors), so these findings are based on reliable news sources citing JMA data.

COUNTER: Based on the available information, the primary driver for the 2024 heatwave was a strong Pacific high-pressure system, consistent with our initial hypothesis. The long-term warming trend is also a significant contributing factor.

Given the difficulty in accessing the raw JMA data, I suggest we proceed with the next step of our plan: historical data comparison. I can search for historical temperature data for Tokyo to quantify the long-term trend and provide context to the 2024 event. What are your thoughts?
