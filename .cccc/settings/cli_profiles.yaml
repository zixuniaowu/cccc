    1) Using POR (North-star/Guardrails/Now-Next-Later), are we off-course? Point the smallest divergence and the evidence.
    2) Which current task is least worth continuing? Remove sunk cost; propose stop/change and one next step.
    3) Where is the latest low-quality artifact or tech-debt mountain? Should we refuse review and rebuild from scratch? Provide the smallest probe and estimate.
    4) Any misalignment, unclear boundary, or ambiguous acceptance? Fix it in the corresponding SUBPOR first, then proceed.
    5) If we only had 1 day: what to drop, what to keep, what to do first? List three bullets.
