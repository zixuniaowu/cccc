    1) Using POR (North-star/Guardrails/Now-Next-Later), are we off-course? Point
    the smallest divergence and the evidence.

    2) Which current task is least worth continuing? Remove sunk cost; propose stop/change
    and one next step.

    3) Where is the latest low-quality artifact or tech-debt mountain? Should we refuse
    review and rebuild from scratch? Provide the smallest probe and estimate.

    4) Any misalignment, unclear boundary, or ambiguous acceptance? Fix it in the
    corresponding SUBPOR first, then proceed.

    5) If we only had 1 day: what to drop, what to keep, what to do first? List three
    bullets.'
